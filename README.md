# Welcome to cloudquery

cloudquery transforms your cloud infrastructure into queryable SQL tables go Graphs for easy monitoring, governance and security.

#### What is cloudquery and why use it?

cloudquery pulls, normalize, expose and monitor your cloud infrastructure and SaaS apps as SQL database. This abstracts various scattered APIs enabling you to define security, governance, cost and compliance policies with SQL.

cloudquery can be easily extended to more resources and SaaS providers \(open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/issues)\).

cloudquery comes with built-in policy packs such as: [AWS CIS](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery#running-policy-packs) \(more is coming!\).

Think about cloudquery as a compliance-as-code tool inspired by tools like [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) and [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), cool right?
